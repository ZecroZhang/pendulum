# Pendulum Simulation
## Running The Simulation
1. Download all the files from GitHub. Unzip if necessary.
2. Make sure all the files(`index.html`, `index.js`, `userInputHandling.js` and `icon.js`) are in the same folder. The TypeScript file will just help with modifying it.
3. Drag and drop the `index.html` into a browser. Only Chrome and Firefox was tested but it will probably work on most browsers.

## Files
`index.html` is the HTML + CSS for the webpage. <br />
`index.js` Stores the pendulum variables and does the math. Also handles the animation frames and visibility changes. <br />
`userInputHandling.js` Generates HTML for the control panel. Modifies the variables in index.js based on the user inputs on the control panel on the right. <br />
`icon.js` Isn't important. I decided to write code for the icon... again...<br />
`types.ts` Two function types to be used in JSDocs.<br />
